While predicting the cases “200KandAbove” which are likely to result in litigation helps early intervention with suitable defence strategies and/or a settlement with claimants to avoid litigation, and reduce litigation expenses, it also helps allocation of appropriately experienced internal resources and attorneys. It also helps prepare expert witnesses to testify and reduce the claim costs. The claims predicted as “100K-lessthan200K”, potentially could develop into unexpected high severity claims of size more than $200K. So it is even more important, in such cases, to evaluate the mutual strengths to convince panel to force arbitration and avoid litigation and/or to explore the possibility of settlement. Identification of cases “lessthan100K”  will help save the resources and allocate them to standard claim settlement operations team for expeditious settlement.
